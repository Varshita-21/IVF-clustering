# An Evaluation of Clustering Algorithms for IVF Vector Indexes

• Implemented and evaluated various clustering algorithms (K-means variants, DBSCAN, CluStream, STREAM) using Faiss to
optimize Inverted File Indexing for high-dimensional vector embeddings in large-scale applications(eg. LLMs).

• Benchmarked algorithms based on key performance metrics: index build time, search efficiency (recall/qps), information loss,
and cluster balance. This analysis aimed to identify an optimal clustering strategy for efficient and accurate retrieval within the IVF framework.
